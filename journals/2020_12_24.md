## Typing in a new page in the search bar will show the suggestion to create a new page and if you press enter, the menu disappears and the search bar does too (Usually it would take you to the new page created). And retrying to create that page will result in the page already created error. So you aren't even able to navigate to the page you were trying to create until you reindex your repo, and only then will the page appear.
