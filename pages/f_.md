title: F*
---

## Anyone uses F* other than MSR?
## Actually I don't care about F\* usage. I'm just testing regex escape for `**`
### Oops, I can't escape asterisk by prepending a backslash in the editor. I have to use double asterisks, which is inconsistent.
### Moreover, the style is wrong too.
## Can Micro$oft stop inventing PLs with special characters which mess up text searching?
